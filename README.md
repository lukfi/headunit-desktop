HeadUnit Desktop is a Qt based free and open source software that is intended to be run on computers built into cars. HUD is designed to be highly modular and easy to extend even for beginners. Make sure you check the documentation out, which is actively being updated.

This software is currently under active development and lot of the features are experimental. The main features are currently:

 - Media player with a media library and media scanner
 - Android Autoâ„¢ client
 - DAB radio

Proposed features:

 - FM Radio
 - CAN bus sniffer (depending on how much control different modules of the car allow and how much information, such as A/C steering wheel controls, different gauges and sensor data) with a customizable profile for each car.

The GUI for some of the proposed features is already there. For screenshots of the current state of the GUI go to the [screenshots page](https://github.com/viktorgino/headunit-desktop/wiki/Screenshots) in the Wiki.
